## libstrophe C library bindings

This crate provides bindings to [libstrophe] C library which enables you the creation of XMPP
clients and servers. The bindings were statically generated using [bindgen] so the crate doesn't
have a hard dependency on bindgen. If you still want to regenerate the bindings during building
of the crate, enable `buildtime_bindgen` feature.

Usage of this crate creates runtime dependency on libstrophe.so so be sure to install that using
your package manager.

Current bindings were generated from libstrophe version: 0.14.0

The difference from [libstrophe-sys] crate is that this one is automatically generated hence
easier to maintain.

This crate contains only C bindings, for Rust ergonomic interface see [libstrophe][libstrophe_crate] crate.
