//! # libstrophe C library bindings
//!
//! This crate provides bindings to [libstrophe] C library which enables you the creation of XMPP
//! clients and servers. The bindings were statically generated using [bindgen] so the crate doesn't
//! have a hard dependency on bindgen. If you still want to regenerate the bindings during building
//! of the create, enable `buildtime_bindgen` feature.
//!
//! Usage of this crate creates runtime dependency on libstrophe.so so be sure to install that using
//! your package manager.
//!
//! Current bindings were generated from libstrophe version: 0.12.0
//!
//! The difference from [libstrophe-sys] crate is that this one is automatically generated hence
//! easier to maintain.
//!
//! This crate contains only C bindings, for Rust ergonomic interface see [libstrophe][libstrophe_crate] crate.
