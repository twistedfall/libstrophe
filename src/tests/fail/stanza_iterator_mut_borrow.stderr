error[E0502]: cannot borrow `stanza` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
 --> $DIR/stanza_iterator_mut_borrow.rs:6:2

5 |     let _a = stanza.children_mut();
  |              ------ mutable borrow occurs here
6 |     stanza.get_first_child();
  |     ^^^^^^ immutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - mutable borrow might be used here, when `_a` is dropped and runs the destructor for type `impl Iterator`
